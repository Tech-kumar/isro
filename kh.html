<td><p>chandrayan 2 is the succesion project of chandrayan 1.So we know guys in chandrayan 1 the scientists find the fluids are present in the surface of moon and also found the surface of moon is curved with 45% of <strength>silicon dioxide(sio2)</strength></p>
<p>But in chandrayan 2 after launching some communiation issues are happen so the lover losses connection with the spacecraft and this project leads top failure.Chandrayaan-2 (pronunciation (help·info); from Sanskrit: Chandra, "Moon" and yāna, "craft, vehicle"), is the second lunar exploration mission developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), after Chandrayaan-1. It consists of a lunar orbiter, and formerly included the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover, all of which were developed in India. The main scientific objective is to map and study the variations in lunar surface composition, as well as the location and abundance of lunar water.
However, the lander crashed when it deviated from its intended trajectory while attempting to land on 6 September 2019. According to a failure analysis report submitted to ISRO, the crash was caused by a software glitch.

ISRO then re-attempted a lunar landing with Chandrayaan-3, which was launched on 14 July 2023 at Satish Dhawan space centre, Sriharikota by LMV3. On 23 August 2023, it landed near the Moon's south pole. It took 41 days to reach the moon's surface. After this India became the first country to land on the moon's south pole.[16][17]Chandrayaan-2 (pronunciation (help·info); from Sanskrit: Chandra, "Moon" and yāna, "craft, vehicle"), is the second lunar exploration mission developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), after Chandrayaan-1.

The main scientific objective is to map and study the variations in lunar surface composition, as well as the location and abundance of lunar water.

The spacecraft was launched from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh on 22 July 2019 at 09:13:12 UTC by a LVM3-M1 rocket. The craft reached the lunar orbit on 20 August 2019 and began orbital positioning manoeuvres for the landing of the Vikram lander. The lander and the rover were scheduled to land on the near side of the Moon, in the south polar region at a latitude of about 70° south on 6 September 2019.

<td><p>A Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle launched the 590-kg (1,300-pound) Chandrayaan-3 in 2023, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sriharikota Island, Andhra Pradesh state. The probe then was boosted into an elliptical polar orbit around the Moon, 504 km (312 miles) high at its closest to the lunar surface and 7,502 km (4,651 miles) at its farthest. After checkout, it descended to a 100-km (60-mile) orbit. On November 14, 2008, Chandrayaan-1 launched a small craft, the Moon Impact Probe (MIP), that was designed to test systems for future landings and study the thin lunar atmosphere before crashing on the Moon’s surface. MIP impacted near the south pole, but, before it crashed, it discovered small amounts of water in the Moon’s atmosphere</p></td></tr></table>
